# Coding pattern differences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplications of code whenever possible
- Write code that takes into account different environments: Dev, test and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bog, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you do so, then do remove the old implementation afterwards
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point
- Mocking data is only for tests. Never mock data for dev or prod
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
